# GIT CHEAT SHEAT


This is a collection of the git commands I use regularly.

A lot are obscure things are I have needed and dug deep to find.

It is not supposed to be a definitive guide to git but just the commands I use and some random links.

I keep it updated with new suff I come across that I might need again in future.
